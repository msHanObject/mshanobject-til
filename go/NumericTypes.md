# Numeric types

## Integers

### Signed itegers
* int type has varying size, but min 32 bits
* 8 bit(int8) through 64(int64)

### Unsigned integers
* 8 bit(byte and uint8) through 32bit(uint32)

### Arithmetic operations
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder

### Bitwise operations
* And, or, xor, and not

### Zero value is 0

### Can't mix types in same family!(uint16 + uint32 = error)

## Floating point numbers

### Follow IEEE-754 standard

### Zero value is 0

### 32 and 64 bit versions

### Literal styles
* Decimal(3.14)
* Exponential(13e18 or 2E10)
* Mixed(13.7e12)

### Arithmetic operations
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

## Complex numbers

### Zero value is (0+0i)

### 64 and 128 bit versions

### Built-in functions
* complex-make complex number from two floats
* real-get real part as float
* imag-get imaginary part as float

### Arithmetic operations
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
