#Planning

To begin with, you'll need to answer these questions:
	1. What is your website about?
		> Do you like dogs, New York, or Pacman?
	2. What information are you presenting on the subject?
		> Write a title and a few paragraphs, and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
	3. What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, catoony, bold and loud, subtle?
